        <div className='home2'>After winning the coin toss and electing to bat first, India lost their
          opening wicket in the third over when Yusuf Pathan mistimed his shot to be caught by Shoaib
          Malik for 15. The next wicket to fall was Robin Uthappa, with another mistimed shot ending his
          innings on eight. Settling down, Gautam Gambhir played his shots (he achieved top score for India
          with 75 from 54 balls including 8 fours and 2 sixes). On the other end, Yuvraj Singh was caught
          out from a Umar Gul delivery to end the 63-run partnership. After MS Dhoni was bowled by Gul for
          6, the innings slowed between over 14 to 18. Rohit Sharma made some late-order hitting which
          brought India to 157 for 5 in the twenty overs. For Pakistan, Gul was the best of the bowlers
          as he took three wickets while Asif and Sohail Tanvir each took a wicket.</div>

          The 1983 World Cup was the third edition of the 50-over tournament
          contested by all the Test-playing nations joined by a few minor countries.
          It found a new winner apart from the two-time champions West Indies, with
          Kapil Dev and his men lifting the trophy at Lord’s. It was the final edition
          with ODIs played for 60 overs rather than 50. Two groups of four teams each
          started the tournament which consisted of 27 matches played over 17 days in
          the month of June.
